# QUINN: A learning tool for quantum circuits. 
Currently, there are many individuals who may want to learn more about quantum, but lack the mathematical foundation to understand quantum operations. 
QUINN aims to solve this problem by providing a visual, interactive way to learn about some basic quantum circuits. 

## Features
QUINN uses Neopixels to create a visual display of matrix operations. For example, negative numbers are green, positive are blue, and zero is red. 
While this is a rudimentary way of observing quantum circuit operations, it will provide complete beginners a starting point.
1. Users can click on pushbuttons resembling quantum gates. This will initiate matrix multiplication.
2. Depending on the value of the matrix afterwards, the Neopixels will light up in certain colors.
3. Users can resent the simulation by clicking on the identity matrix button three times.
